# awesome-widgets
A collection of various widgets I've developed for awesomewm

**Unless otherwise noted, a widget may be added to your config by simply adding `require("WIDGETNAME")` to your rc.lua**

**Change em, modify em, use em exactly as they are, but please leave the credit in the comments at the top of the file if you are using code from here:)**
